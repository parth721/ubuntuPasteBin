Hello, I  want solve some issues related to containerization & deployment on minikube. 
I created an web-app with frontend, backend, database. I containerize & deploy it on minikube as a single container.
Now I'm trying to use service mesh in it. So I'm trying to create separate image & run in different pods & connect them with service mesh(istio).
The issue I'm facing is that unable to create separate images?
